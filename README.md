packer-lfs
==========

This is a work-in-progress/proof-of-concept with the goal of using
[Packer](http://www.packer.io) to automate the build of a low-overhead Linux
system based on [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org).

Assuming it is successful, it could become the basis for a new LFS live CD.

This project is still in its infancy; it does not yet build anything usable.
